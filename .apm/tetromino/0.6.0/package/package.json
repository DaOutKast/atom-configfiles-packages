I just wanted the same kind of useful tool with Atom.\n\n![TetrominoDemo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vhiribarren/atom-tetromino/master/materials/tetromino.gif)\n\n## Commands\n\nOpen the game using the command palette `Tetromino: Play` or the `Tetromino` sub-menu in the `Packages` menu.\n\nThe current commands to play the game are:\n\n- `left`: move block to left\n- `right`: move block to right\n- `bottom`: accelerate drop of block\n- `up`: rotate block to right\n- `space`: rotate block to right\n- `alt`: rotate block to left\n- `p`: pause\n\n## Contributions\n\nContributions and bug reports are welcome. Please keep in mind that the whole idea of the project is to have a minimalist implementation of the tetromino falling block game, so the game must not evolve too much. It is only for fun, like the Emacs tetromino game.\n\n[tetromino-wikipedia]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetromino\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/vhiribarren/atom-tetromino/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/vhiribarren/atom-tetromino#readme","_id":"tetromino@0.6.0","_shasum":"8f6d11ff9a58a099e658a3a4b90a65bece0d6e61","_resolved":"file:..\\d-11697-22176-1ewgjpi\\package.tgz","_from":"..\\d-11697-22176-1ewgjpi\\package.tgz"}
